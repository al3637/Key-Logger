# Key Logger

This is a keylogger that I am currently working on. The keylogger detects which keys are being pressed on your keyboard. It then stores those values in a seperate file called "clean.txt".

In order for it to run, your computer needs to have the "keyboard" package which you can get by entering "pip install keyboard".

To stop the program from running, press the "esc" key.
